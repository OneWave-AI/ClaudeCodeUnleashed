    prompt: `🐝 **SWARM AUDIT MODE ACTIVATED**

Analyze the current situation, our recent conversation, and the codebase context. You need to launch a coordinated agent swarm (minimum 3 agents) to audit and review.

**YOUR TASK:**
1. First, briefly analyze what we've been working on and what needs attention
2. Then CHOOSE 3-5 specialized agents that are most relevant to THIS specific situation
3. For each agent you spawn, clearly announce: "🐝 Spawning Agent: [Name] - [Role]"
4. Have each agent perform their analysis and report findings

**AGENT SELECTION GUIDELINES:**
Pick agents based on what's actually needed. Examples of agent types you might choose:
- Code Quality Reviewer (patterns, structure, readability)
- Security Auditor (vulnerabilities, auth, data handling)
- Performance Analyst (bottlenecks, optimization)
- API Reviewer (endpoints, contracts, error handling)
- UI/UX Reviewer (accessibility, responsiveness, UX)
- Test Coverage Analyst (missing tests, edge cases)
- Type Safety Reviewer (TypeScript, type coverage)

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
For each agent, provide:
- Agent name and role
- Key findings (with file:line references)
- Severity: 🔴 Critical | 🟠 Warning | 🟡 Info
- Recommended actions

Based on our conversation and any previous audit findings, launch a coordinated agent swarm (minimum 3 agents) to take action and implement improvements.

**YOUR TASK:**
1. First, summarize what needs to be fixed/improved based on context
2. Then CHOOSE 3-5 specialized agents that can best address these issues
3. For each agent you spawn, clearly announce: "🐝 Spawning Agent: [Name] - [Mission]"
4. Have each agent execute their tasks and show the changes

**AGENT SELECTION GUIDELINES:**
Pick agents based on what actions are actually needed. Examples:
- Bug Fixer (fix identified bugs, handle edge cases)
- Security Patcher (fix vulnerabilities, add validation)
- Performance Optimizer (optimize slow code, add caching)
- Refactoring Agent (clean up code, improve structure)
- Test Writer (add unit tests, integration tests)
- Type Fixer (add/fix TypeScript types)
- Error Handler (add try/catch, improve error messages)

**EXECUTION RULES:**
- Prioritize: 🔴 Security first → 🟠 Bugs → 🟡 Improvements
- Show each change with file:line references
- Explain what was changed and why
- Each agent should complete their task before the next begins
